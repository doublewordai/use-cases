# Data Labelling

Label large datasets (images, documents, text) using batch processing. Achieve human-level accuracy at a fraction of the cost.

## The idea

Manual labelling is expensive and slow. LLM labelling via batch:
- Costs pennies per label instead of dollars
- Scales to millions of items
- Maintains consistent quality

## Suggested approach

- Take a dataset with some human labels (for validation)
- Define labelling taxonomy
- Run batch labelling
- Measure accuracy vs human labels
- Calculate cost per label, compare to human labelling services
