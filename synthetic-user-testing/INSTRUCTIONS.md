# Synthetic User Testing

Generate thousands of diverse user personas, simulate their experience with a product, cluster the feedback. Surface issues that small-sample testing misses.

## The idea

Real user testing is limited by sample size and diversity. Synthetic populations let you:
- Simulate thousands of users with varied backgrounds, goals, technical ability
- Find edge cases and failure modes across the full persona space
- Quantify "12% of users with X characteristic struggle at step Y"

## Suggested approach

- Take a product (your own, or an open-source tool with real GitHub issues)
- Generate diverse personas
- Simulate each persona's experience
- Cluster feedback by theme
- Validate against real user feedback if available
